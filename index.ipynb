    "In this section, we'll take a more formal look at *NumPy*. Besides being ubiquitous in Data Science, NumPy also provides us with blistering fast and efficient, list-like, data types called N-Dimensional Arrays or **ndarrays** or more simply arrays. This list-like data type is effectively a lighter weight version of a Python **list**, as it uses less of your computer's memory, which makes it more efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. Don't worry if that seems a little vague. We will take a closer look at NumPy and how its arrays work in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note: *Pandas* was actually built on top of *NumPy*! So many of the functionalities that *NumPy* has, are also part of *Pandas*. It is still important to cover *NumPy* separately as *NumPy* arrays are very important building blocks in many Data Science applications!\n",

    "- Instantiate a NumPy array with specified values \n",
    "- Use broadcasting to perform a math operation on an entire NumPy array \n",

    "Just like with any other library, we need to first install the library with a package manager like `pip`. We have already installed this library in the background, so, no need to worry about this step. Next, we need to import the dependency into our code. \n",
